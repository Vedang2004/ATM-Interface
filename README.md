# ATM-Interface
Hello!

Welcome to my project : ATM INTERFACE

The ATMs in our cities are built on Python, as we have all seen them. It is a console-based application with five different classes. In order to use the system, the user must enter his or her user ID and pin when it starts. Once the details are entered successfully, ATM functionality is unlocked. As a result of the project, the following operations can be performed:

1. Transactions History
2. Withdraw
3. Deposit
4. Transfer
5. Quit

Pre-Defined Records to work upon are :

1.	User ID : vedang
	Pin	: 2004
	Balance	: 10000

2.	User ID : octanet
	Pin	: 2024
	Balance	: 100000

3.	User ID : intern
	Pin	: 2023
	Balance	: 1000 

Note : User can create new records using create_record() function whose code is already written in the program. User just have to add one line to the main function to execute create_record function to create records mutiple time. Line : create_record()
